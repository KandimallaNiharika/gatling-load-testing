TASK 4 – LOAD TESTING WITH GATLING


1. INTRODUCTION
Load testing is a critical performance testing technique used to determine how a system behaves under expected and peak user loads. This task focuses on performing advanced load testing using Gatling.


2. OBJECTIVE
The objective of this task was to:
- Simulate heavy user load on a web application
- Analyze system performance under stress
- Identify response times and throughput
- Verify system stability during peak usage


3. TOOL USED
Gatling was used for this task due to its high performance, Scala-based scripting, and rich HTML reporting features.


4. TEST ENVIRONMENT
- Operating System: Linux
- Tool: Gatling
- Test Type: Load Testing
- Simulation Language: Scala


5. TEST EXECUTION
A custom Gatling simulation was created to simulate multiple concurrent users accessing the application. The simulation was executed using the Gatling command-line interface.


6. PERFORMANCE METRICS ANALYZED
- Number of requests
- Response time (min, max, average)
- Requests per second
- Active users over time
- Success and failure rates


7. RESULTS
- The system handled concurrent user requests successfully
- Average response time remained within acceptable limits
- No major failures or crashes occurred during testing
- System performance was stable under simulated load


8. CONCLUSION
The load testing exercise using Gatling was successfully completed. The system demonstrated good stability and performance under heavy load conditions. This task provided hands-on experience with performance testing and report analysis.
